## Contract Changes

<!-- Append new entries at the bottom -->

### [2026-04-04] Setup agent — initial boundary definitions

```
agent: setup
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.contracts
symbol: ArtifactRef, DatasetId, TrustVerdict, LineageNode
old: N/A (new)
new: Shared contract types for cross-sector communication
impact: all agents
docs_updated: yes
notes: Initial shared contracts package. Types are placeholders — agents must finalize signatures.
```

### [2026-04-04] Setup agent — boundary cleanup pass

```
agent: setup
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.labels.public (new), mt5pipe.features.public, mt5pipe.state.__init__, mt5pipe.compiler.__init__, mt5pipe.features.__init__, mt5pipe.labels.__init__
symbol: LabelPack, LabelService (added to features.public), all __init__ re-route through public.py
old: __init__.py exported directly from models/service internals; labels had no public.py
new: all sector __init__.py re-export from public.py only; labels.public.py added as intra-sector boundary; features.public.py re-exports labels surface for cross-sector consumers
impact: all agents — no import paths changed externally, but __init__ now routes through public
docs_updated: yes
notes: Cleanup only. No implementation changes.
```

### [2026-04-04 20:05]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.public, mt5pipe.labels.public
symbol: FeatureBuilder, FeatureArtifactRef, load_feature_artifact, get_default_feature_specs, resolve_feature_selectors, LabelArtifactRef, load_label_artifact, get_default_label_packs, resolve_label_pack
old: public surfaces exported only FeatureSpec/FeatureService/basic family builders and LabelPack/LabelService
new: public surfaces now expose registry helpers plus stable artifact ref/loader symbols for persisted feature and label views
impact: compiler/tests/future cross-sector consumers can depend on features.public and labels.public without reaching into registry or storage internals
docs_updated: yes
notes: loaders use StoragePaths + ParquetStore and keep label behavior unchanged
```

### [2026-04-04 20:05]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.registry.defaults
symbol: disagreement.microstructure_pressure@1.0.0, event_shape.flow_shape@1.0.0, entropy.market_complexity@1.0.0
old: stable registry covered only time/session/quality/htf_context families
new: adds three stable Phase 3 machine-native feature families with explicit dependencies, warmup rows, PIT safety, and output columns
impact: dataset specs can now resolve disagreement/*, event_shape/*, and entropy/*
docs_updated: yes
notes: all three families remain M1/BuiltBar-compatible so Agent 3 can compile them without compiler redesign
```
### [2026-04-04 20:40]
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.contracts.artifacts, mt5pipe.contracts.state
symbol: ArtifactKind(CANONICAL_TICK, STATE_WINDOW), TickArtifactRef, StateArtifactRef, StateWindowArtifactRef, StateWindowRequest, parse_window_size
old: shared contracts only exposed generic ArtifactRef/DatasetId/TrustVerdict/LineageNode
new: state-specific artifact refs and rolling-window request contract are now first-class shared types for cross-sector state access
impact: Agent 2 can depend on typed state/tick/window refs; Agent 3 can pass/record state refs without importing state internals
docs_updated: no
notes: window sizes use compact strings like 30s/60s/5m; refs are range-based and artifact-id driven.

### [2026-04-04 20:40]
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.state.public
symbol: StateArtifactManifest, StateArtifactRef, StateWindowArtifactRef, StateWindowRecord, StateWindowRequest, TickArtifactRef, StateBuilder, StateService, load_state_artifact, materialize_state_windows
old: state.public only re-exported StateSnapshot and StateService
new: state.public now exposes the stable state-sector substrate for state/tick artifacts and machine-native rolling state windows
impact: Agent 2 should import state substrate from mt5pipe.state.public only; Agent 3 can keep calling StateService while the boundary is now explicit
docs_updated: no
notes: state sector no longer imports compiler/catalog internals; manifests are written by local state helpers and can still be handed to compiler catalog duck-typed.

### [2026-04-04 20:58]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.compiler.public, mt5pipe.compiler.service, mt5pipe.compiler.models.LineageManifest.metadata
symbol: compile_dataset_spec, inspect_artifact, diff_artifacts, ArtifactInspection, ArtifactDiff, DatasetSpec.state_artifact_ref/feature_artifact_refs/label_artifact_ref
old: compiler-era dataset builds mainly assumed version-ref materialization, compiler.public did not present compile/inspect/diff as one stable surface, and artifact-ref state builds could not honor filled-row filtering from public state artifacts
new: compiler.public re-exports compile/inspect/diff dataclasses and helpers; compiler manifests/inspection metadata now carry requested_feature_selectors, feature_artifact_refs, source_modes, build_row_stats, split_row_counts, state_artifact_ref, and label_artifact_ref; artifact-ref state builds derive filled-row exclusion from public state trust flags when raw _filled markers are not present
impact: CLI/tests/other agents can stay on mt5pipe.compiler.public and artifact-backed Phase 3 datasets remain inspectable/diffable without cross-sector internal imports
docs_updated: yes
notes: config/datasets/xau_m1_nonhuman_v1.yaml is the Phase 3 example spec; real workspace execution still requires the referenced machine-native feature artifacts to be present in the local catalog/worktree
```

### [2026-04-04 20:58]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.truth.service
symbol: TruthService.evaluate_dataset / TrustReport publish gate
old: truth evaluation only covered coarse dataset quality and did not explicitly reject the main Phase 3 artifact failure modes
new: truth gate now enforces coverage, split integrity, duplicate primary-clock rows/leakage, required feature columns, per-family missingness thresholds for time/session/quality/htf_context/disagreement/event_shape/entropy, warmup/drop-row sanity, source quality, lineage completeness, and manifest hash integrity; hard-failure codes now include dataset_coverage_failure, split_integrity_failure, leakage_or_duplicate_timestamp_failure, missing_required_feature_columns, feature_family_missingness_threshold_exceeded, warmup_or_drop_row_sanity_failure, source_quality_below_threshold, lineage_incomplete, and manifest_hash_mismatch
impact: compiler publication is deterministically blocked on bad Phase 3 artifacts and inspect/diff consumers can rely on richer trust reports
docs_updated: yes
notes: source quality now treats merge QA as a modifier on state quality instead of double-penalizing conflict behavior already reflected in state quality_score
```

### [2026-04-04 20:58]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.cli.dataset_cmds
symbol: dataset compile-dataset, inspect-dataset, diff-dataset
old: CLI summaries omitted artifact-ref/source-mode/build-row detail and compile output did not expose explicit publish control
new: compile-dataset supports --publish/--no-publish and prints split_rows; inspect-dataset and diff-dataset emit deterministic summaries for requested feature selectors, feature artifact refs, source modes, and build row stats
impact: Phase 3 datasets can be inspected and compared from the CLI without manually opening manifest JSON
docs_updated: yes
notes: output mirrors compiler manifest metadata for inspectability and diffability
```

### [2026-04-04 21:37]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.public, mt5pipe.features.registry.defaults
symbol: add_multiscale_features, multiscale.consistency@1.0.0
old: public surface exposed disagreement/event_shape/entropy as the only machine-native families; no stable multiscale selector existed
new: features.public now re-exports add_multiscale_features and the default registry now resolves multiscale/* to multiscale.consistency@1.0.0 with explicit warmup/dependencies/output columns
impact: compiler/dataset specs can consume multiscale/* without touching feature internals; Agent 3 can compile the new stable selector directly
docs_updated: yes
notes: multiscale.consistency@1.0.0 outputs trend_alignment_5_15_60, return_energy_ratio_5_60, volatility_ratio_5_60, range_expansion_ratio_15_60, and tick_intensity_ratio_5_60
```

### [2026-04-04 21:37]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.disagreement, mt5pipe.features.event_shape, mt5pipe.features.entropy, mt5pipe.features.labels, mt5pipe.labels.service
symbol: Phase 3 machine-native family warmup/missingness behavior; triple_barrier_* tail semantics; label manifest metadata.label_diagnostics
old: disagreement/event_shape/entropy emitted some early-row values before warmup and could synthesize numeric outputs from missing core inputs; triple_barrier_* treated insufficient forward horizon as time-expiry 0; label manifests exposed only basic row/column metadata
new: disagreement/event_shape/entropy now null all family outputs through declared warmup rows and degrade to typed-null columns when core inputs are missing; triple_barrier_* now returns null for insufficient forward horizon and includes the full horizon endpoint; label manifests now include compact horizon/class-balance diagnostics plus exclusions
impact: compiler/truth consumers should expect cleaner warmup/tail nulls for machine-native features and labels, plus richer label artifact metadata for inspectability
docs_updated: yes
notes: label pack key and output column names stay unchanged; only tail availability semantics and manifest metadata became stricter
```
### [2026-04-04 21:38]

```
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.state.models.StateSnapshot, mt5pipe.state.models.StateArtifactManifest, mt5pipe.state.models.StateWindowRecord
symbol: StateSnapshot.expected_interval_ms/observed_interval_ms/source_participation_score/overlap_confidence_hint/gap_fill_flag, StateCoverageSummary, StateSourceQualitySummary, StateArtifactManifest.coverage_summary/source_quality_summary/time-range fields, StateWindowRecord warmup/completeness/gap/source-quality fields
old: state artifacts exposed basic snapshot/window structure with limited completeness and source-quality metadata
new: state artifacts now carry typed coverage and source-quality summaries plus per-snapshot/per-window completeness, participation, overlap-confidence, staleness, and gap-fill annotations suitable for wider-range machine-native builds
impact: Agent 2 can consume richer PIT-safe state/window metadata from mt5pipe.state.public; Agent 3/compiler/truth can reason about time range, coverage, and source quality from state manifests without guessing
docs_updated: no
notes: additive shape expansion only; no merge/backfill semantics changed
```

### [2026-04-04 21:38]

```
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.state.public
symbol: StateCoverageSummary, StateSourceQualitySummary, load_state_window_artifact
old: state.public exposed snapshot/window contracts and load_state_artifact/materialize_state_windows but not typed coverage/source-quality summaries or a public window-artifact loader
new: state.public now exports typed coverage/source-quality summary models and load_state_window_artifact for stable cross-sector access to persisted rolling windows
impact: Agent 2/3 can stay on mt5pipe.state.public for window metadata and persisted window loading
docs_updated: no
notes: public surface remains additive and boundary-clean
```

### [2026-04-04 22:44]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.truth.service, mt5pipe.cli.dataset_cmds
symbol: TrustReport.metrics.dataset_quality, warning_reasons semantics, compile-dataset|inspect-dataset|diff-dataset trust summaries
old: truth warning reasons were coarse and sometimes duplicative; trust metrics did not surface compact dataset-quality detail; CLI summaries omitted decision_summary, rejection/warning reasons, and check-status counts
new: truth reports now include dataset_quality metrics (quality_score, total_nulls, null-columns map, constant-columns list, duplicate timestamp count) and emit more specific warning reasons for source quality, null columns, and constant columns without duplicating generic warning codes; compile/inspect/diff now print trust_decision, trust_check_counts, trust_warning_reasons, and trust_rejection_reasons, with diff exposing trust-reason deltas
impact: research users can diagnose accepted/rejected artifacts directly from compiler outputs without opening manifest/trust JSON by hand
docs_updated: yes
notes: this is a reporting hardening change only; trust hard-fail thresholds were not relaxed
```

### [2026-04-04 22:44]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: config/datasets/xau_m1_nonhuman_v1.yaml, config/datasets/xau_m1_core_v1.yaml
symbol: example DatasetSpec selector bundle and synchronized date range
old: example specs targeted a narrow 2026 slice; xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 pinned stale feature_artifact_refs that were no longer the stable machine-native path
new: example specs now target the wider synchronized range 2024-02-26..2024-03-01; xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 compiles from stable public selectors only and includes multiscale/* while removing explicit feature_artifact_refs
impact: compiler-facing workflows and tests now exercise the real Phase 4 checkpoint path through state_version_ref + stable selectors instead of stale artifact aliases
docs_updated: yes
notes: multiscale/* is included because the current public feature registry resolves multiscale.consistency@1.0.0 cleanly in the live workspace and focused tests
```

### [2026-04-04 23:34]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.truth.service, mt5pipe.cli.dataset_cmds
symbol: TrustReport.metrics.quality_caveat_summary semantics, TrustReport.metrics.source_quality observability detail, compile-dataset|inspect-dataset|diff-dataset quality/trust summary lines
old: expected sparse nulls and slice-trivial constants were emitted as generic dataset warnings alongside real blockers; source-quality reporting did not distinguish merge_qa from merge_diagnostics fallback; CLI output did not surface accepted caveats, per-family caveat summaries, or source-quality context directly
new: truth reports now classify expected sparse nulls and slice-trivial constants as accepted_caveats, keep unexpected nulls/blocking constants/source-quality shortfalls in green_blockers or publication_blockers, and expose merge_diagnostics fallback metrics inside source_quality; compile/inspect/diff now print quality_caveats, source_quality_metrics, and per-family quality summaries, with diff also printing feature_families_left/right
impact: Phase 4 checkpoint review can distinguish accepted slice behavior from true blockers deterministically from CLI output; artifacts can return to green when only accepted caveats remain without hiding those caveats
docs_updated: yes
notes: trust hard-fail thresholds remain unchanged; this is a truth/reporting hardening pass rather than a publication-gate relaxation
```

### [2026-04-04 22:31]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.labels.service
symbol: label manifest metadata.label_diagnostics.horizons_minutes/max_horizon_minutes/recommended_min_embargo_rows
old: label_diagnostics exposed per-horizon null/class-balance summaries plus purge_rows/exclusions, but did not explicitly summarize the pack-wide horizon span or recommended embargo floor
new: label_diagnostics now also includes horizons_minutes, max_horizon_minutes, and recommended_min_embargo_rows to make purge/embargo expectations explicit for compiler/inspection consumers
impact: inspect/diff/trust consumers can reason about label horizon scope and minimum safe embargo directly from label artifact metadata without inferring it from raw columns
docs_updated: yes
notes: additive metadata only; label pack key, output columns, and generation logic stay unchanged
```
### [2026-04-04 22:30]

```
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.state.public / mt5pipe.state.service materialize_state_windows
symbol: materialize_state_windows request-range behavior
old: when a source StateArtifactRef/TickArtifactRef spanned a wider date range than the request, state windows were built across the full source and returned anchors outside the requested date range; lineage refs also only covered the request dates
new: state windows may still use a wider source artifact for PIT-safe warmup context, but emitted window anchors are filtered to the requested date range, request dates must lie within the source ref range, and lineage/input refs cover the full source range actually used
impact: Agent 2 can rely on state-window artifacts matching requested anchor dates while preserving prior-context warmup; Agent 3 can rely on state-window lineage covering the actual source partitions used
docs_updated: no
notes: no public symbol additions; boundary behavior is stricter and more deterministic for wider-range requests
```

### [2026-04-04 23:33]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.registry.defaults
symbol: htf_context.standard_context@1.0.0, disagreement.microstructure_pressure@1.0.0
old: stable htf_context/* exposed higher-timeframe *_tick_count columns; stable disagreement/* exposed spread_divergence_proxy_bps, conflict_burst_15, staleness_asymmetry_15, and disagreement_entropy_30 alongside the core pressure fields
new: stable htf_context/* now excludes *_tick_count from production output columns; stable disagreement/* is narrowed to mid_divergence_proxy_bps, disagreement_pressure_bps, disagreement_zscore_60, and disagreement_burst_15
impact: compiler/truth/dataset specs keep the same family selectors, but published feature artifacts for the stable selector set now omit the null-heavy HTF tick-count columns and the slice-trivial disagreement columns
docs_updated: yes
notes: builders still compute the broader internal disagreement surface; only the stable registry contract was tightened for the current nonhuman path
```

### [2026-04-04 23:33]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.disagreement, mt5pipe.features.event_shape, mt5pipe.labels.service
symbol: disagreement/* warmup semantics, event_shape/* warmup semantics, metadata.label_diagnostics.constant_output_columns
old: disagreement/event_shape cleanup still effectively assumed family-wide warmup in tests, and label diagnostics did not explicitly report constant output columns
new: disagreement/* and event_shape/* now treat warmup at the column level (instantaneous columns can materialize immediately while rolling columns stay null until ready); label diagnostics now include constant_output_columns for the current label artifact
impact: compiler/truth consumers should expect earlier availability for non-rolling event/disagreement columns and can classify trivial labels directly from manifest metadata
docs_updated: yes
notes: no label pack keys or column names changed
```

### [2026-04-05 00:05]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.registry.models, mt5pipe.features.registry.defaults, mt5pipe.labels.registry.models, mt5pipe.labels.registry.defaults
symbol: FeatureSpec.ablation_group/trainability_tags, LabelPack.qa_policy_ref/ablation_group/trainability_tags/target_groups/tail_policy, stable registry defaults
old: registry entries exposed status/tags plus core shape, but had no explicit experiment-group metadata or label-pack trainability metadata
new: feature specs now carry ablation_group and trainability_tags; label packs now carry qa_policy_ref, ablation_group, trainability_tags, target_groups, and tail_policy; stable defaults populate those fields for the production selector set and core_tb_volscaled@1.0.0
impact: compiler/catalog/training consumers can group stable features by ablation bucket and inspect label-pack training assumptions without inferring them from names alone
docs_updated: yes
notes: additive only; no existing feature keys, label-pack keys, or output column names changed
```

### [2026-04-05 00:05]

```
agent: agent_2
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.features.service, mt5pipe.labels.service
symbol: feature_view manifest metadata.trainability_diagnostics, label_view metadata.label_diagnostics/trainability fields, direction_threshold_bps service behavior
old: feature artifacts exposed only basic row/column/output metadata; label artifacts exposed horizon/tail/class-balance diagnostics but not experiment-readiness summaries, target-distribution summaries, or pack-level trainability metadata; label service ignored direction-threshold pack parameters
new: feature artifacts now publish family/status/ablation/tags plus trainability_diagnostics with post-warmup coverage, complete-row ratio, constant/low-variation/null-heavy columns, and warning reasons; label artifacts now publish pack-level trainability metadata, target-distribution summaries, degenerate-horizon warnings, and direction-threshold/barrier settings, and label service honors parameters.direction_threshold_bps when materializing direction_* targets
impact: Agent 3 and downstream training workflows can inspect whether a feature family or label horizon is trainable directly from artifact metadata, and future label packs can tighten direction targets without changing generator plumbing
docs_updated: yes
notes: default core_tb_volscaled@1.0.0 keeps direction_threshold_bps=0.0, so current output semantics stay unchanged unless a pack explicitly opts in
```
### [2026-04-04 23:32]

```
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.state.service / mt5pipe.state.public load_state_artifact, load_state_window_artifact, materialize_state
symbol: persisted state/state-window idempotence and canonical-quality-backed source_quality behavior
old: repeated state or state-window materialization could append duplicate persisted rows because state partitions were not rewritten idempotently and loaders returned concatenated duplicates; bar-backed state quality/source_quality_hint relied only on coarse bar-level heuristics even when canonical tick quality evidence was available
new: state and state-window partition writes are reset before rewrite and public loaders deduplicate on stable keys, making persisted loads idempotent; bar-backed state quality_score/source_quality_hint now prefer per-bar canonical tick quality/conflict/dual-source evidence when available
impact: Agent 2 and Agent 3 can rely on stable persisted state/state-window loads and more informative source-quality inputs on the current nonhuman dataset path without importing truth/compiler internals
docs_updated: no
notes: additive behavioral hardening only; no new public symbols or contract fields were introduced
```
### [2026-04-05 00:06]

```
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.contracts.state
symbol: TickArtifactRef, StateArtifactRef, StateWindowArtifactRef, StateWindowRequest normalization behavior
old: typed state refs/requests preserved incoming symbol, clock, and window-size casing verbatim, so callers could accidentally depend on xauusd vs XAUUSD or m1 vs M1 differences
new: state refs/requests now normalize symbol -> upper-case, clock -> upper-case, window_size -> normalized compact lower-case form, and trim state_version/source_artifact_id strings
impact: Agent 2/3 and future callers can treat state refs/requests as case-stable contracts; later symbol additions such as XAGUSD/USOIL will not require casing-specific workarounds at the state boundary
docs_updated: no
notes: additive hygiene only; no path semantics or merge/backfill behavior changed
```

### [2026-04-05 00:06]

```
agent: agent_1
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.state.models, mt5pipe.state.public, mt5pipe.state.service
symbol: StateReadinessSummary, StateIntervalReadinessSummary, StateArtifactManifest.readiness_summary/daily_readiness_rollups/session_readiness_rollups, StateMaterializationResult.readiness_summary, StateWindowMaterializationResult.readiness_summary
old: state manifests/results exposed coverage_summary and source_quality_summary, but did not provide typed range-level readiness metadata, daily/session rollups, or window-availability summaries for downstream truth/training consumers
new: state artifacts now expose typed readiness summaries with effective coverage, gap burden, overlap/source reliability bands, readiness bands, and window-availability ratios; manifests/results also carry daily and per-day-session readiness rollups through mt5pipe.state.public
impact: Agent 2 and Agent 3 can rely on stable state-side training-readiness metadata without importing state internals or re-deriving rollups downstream
docs_updated: no
notes: additive shape expansion only; current public symbols remain stable and no new service entrypoints were added
```

### [2026-04-05 00:35]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.compiler.models, mt5pipe.compiler.manifest, mt5pipe.compiler.public
symbol: ArtifactKind(experiment, model), ArtifactStatus(trial), ExperimentSpec, LineageManifest.experiment_spec_ref, load_experiment_spec, run_experiment_spec, inspect_experiment, inspect_model, ExperimentRunResult, ExperimentInspection, ModelInspection
old: compiler public surface only covered dataset compilation/inspection/diff; manifests only linked dataset specs; no typed experiment spec or compiler-owned experiment/model artifact surface existed
new: compiler now exposes a first-class training/evaluation boundary with ExperimentSpec plus public run/inspect helpers for experiment/model artifacts, and manifests can link experiment specs through experiment_spec_ref while artifact kinds now include experiment/model and model status can be trial
impact: compiler-facing consumers can run trust-gated experiments and inspect experiment/model lineage without importing compiler internals; catalog/manifests can represent the first training registry layer cleanly
docs_updated: yes
notes: the first example spec is config/experiments/xau_m1_nonhuman_direction_nb_v1.yaml and targets dataset://xau_m1_nonhuman@1.0.0 with direction_60m
```

agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.catalog.sqlite, mt5pipe.storage.paths, mt5pipe.cli.train_cmds
symbol: experiment_specs/training_runs catalog tables, experiment:// and model:// alias lifecycle, compact experiment/model storage roots, train run-experiment|inspect-experiment|inspect-model
old: catalog only tracked dataset specs/build runs/truth-backed artifacts; storage path conventions only covered datasets/manifests/truth; there was no compiler-facing training CLI
new: catalog now persists experiment specs and training-run lifecycle metadata linked to dataset/model artifact ids; experiment/model artifacts are registered through the shared artifact catalog and resolved via explicit experiment:// and model:// aliases; storage roots for experiment/model artifacts use compact path segments to stay Windows-safe; the CLI now exposes minimal train commands for running and inspecting trust-gated experiments
impact: training/evaluation runs are reproducible, inspectable, and lineage-linked through the existing catalog/manifests while remaining usable on Windows workspaces
docs_updated: yes
notes: training still hard-gates on dataset trust acceptance and currently ships one deterministic baseline model family, gaussian_nb_binary@1.0.0
```

### [2026-04-05 15:31]

```
agent: agent_3
type: contract-change
module: mt5pipe.compiler.models, mt5pipe.truth.service, config/datasets/xau_m1_core_v1.yaml, config/datasets/xau_m1_nonhuman_v1.yaml
symbol: DatasetSpec.required_raw_brokers, require_synchronized_raw_coverage, require_dual_source_overlap, min_dual_source_ratio; source_quality trust enforcement
old: dataset specs could describe the current ML path without explicitly declaring raw-broker requirements, and truth could still accept/publish a single-source dataset even when the intended research path depended on synchronized multi-broker quality
new: dataset specs can now declare required raw brokers, synchronized raw coverage, dual-source overlap, and a minimum effective dual-source ratio; truth treats those as hard publication requirements and reports missing/asymmetric raw dates plus dual-source failures directly in source_quality metrics/reasons
impact: compiler-owned ML specs can now prove and enforce that the production dataset window is genuinely dual-broker rather than merely trusting merge artifacts opportunistically
docs_updated: yes
notes: current production specs moved to the synchronized live slice 2026-03-30..2026-04-02 and require broker_a + broker_b with min_dual_source_ratio=0.10
```

module: mt5pipe.storage.paths, mt5pipe.state.service, mt5pipe.features.service, mt5pipe.labels.service, mt5pipe.state.public, mt5pipe.features.public, mt5pipe.labels.public
symbol: immutable upstream artifact_uri / artifact-scoped parquet roots for state, feature_view, label_view
old: state, feature, and label manifests pointed at mutable logical roots, so upstream lineage was logically named but not content-addressed enough for reproducible reloads after reruns
new: manifests now point at compact artifact-scoped parquet roots keyed by artifact id/version, writers mirror outputs into those immutable roots, and public loaders prefer artifact-scoped partitions before falling back to legacy logical roots
impact: dataset manifests and downstream training artifacts now anchor lineage to stable upstream parquet snapshots without breaking existing logical-resolution flows
docs_updated: yes
notes: legacy logical roots are still written for compatibility; new loaders resolve immutable roots whenever artifact_id is available
```

symbol: raw ingest row accounting, gap-fill behavior, canonical per-day diagnostics canonicalization
old: raw tick ingest totals reflected post-write file sizes rather than net-new deduped rows, historical day gap fills could be skipped when checkpoints were already ahead, and merge diagnostics/QA could accumulate duplicate per-day files across reruns
new: tick storage returns net-new rows added after dedup and registers written partitions in the file manifest; day-level backfill gap fills run even when checkpoints are ahead while preserving monotonic checkpoints; merge diagnostics and merge QA now rewrite one canonical summary file per day on rerun
impact: raw completeness claims, rerun idempotence, and daily merge observability are now auditable from actual stored artifacts instead of inflated counters or duplicated summaries
docs_updated: yes
notes: canonical tick parquet dedup now also keys on ts_msc/ts_utc/bar_start/anchor_ts_utc where present to prevent append-style rerun duplication
