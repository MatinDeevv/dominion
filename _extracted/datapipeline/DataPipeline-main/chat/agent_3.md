# Agent 3 — Compiler / Truth / Catalog

[Human feedback rule]

Treat `feedbacks/latest.md` as the highest-priority human steering note before new work begins.

Before starting any new work:
1. Check whether `feedbacks/latest.md` exists and is non-empty.
2. If it exists, read it fully before doing anything else.
3. In your agent log, record:
	- `feedback_read: yes`
	- `feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md`
	- `feedback_summary: <1-3 lines>`
4. Follow the latest human review unless it directly conflicts with the active task/prompt.
5. If there is a conflict, log it in `chat/coordination.md` before proceeding.

Do not put human feedback notes into `chat/contracts.md`.
Use:
- `feedbacks/latest.md` for human review
- `chat/contracts.md` for boundary/API/schema changes
- `chat/coordination.md` for blockers, requests, handoffs, and coordination

### [2026-04-04 20:16:24 -04:00] agent_3 - start

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler
summary: Started Phase 3 compiler/truth/catalog/CLI pass. Reading current compiler-facing codepaths and dataset/test layout before implementing xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 end-to-end compile support.
needs: Will adapt to Agent 1/2 boundary changes through public modules only.

### [2026-04-04 20:58:00 -04:00] agent_3 - phase3 pass complete

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: No active human review yet.

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli
summary: Implemented artifact-ref-aware compiler integration, Phase 3 truth gating, richer inspect/diff CLI summaries, and added the xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 example spec plus compiler-facing integration tests. Artifact-backed state builds now honor exclude:filled_rows through public state trust flags and/or _filled without importing state internals.
needs: Real workspace execution of config/datasets/xau_m1_nonhuman_v1.yaml still depends on Agent 2 machine-native feature artifacts being present in the local catalog/worktree. The compiler path and tests are ready for that boundary through mt5pipe.features.public and artifact refs only.

```

### [2026-04-04 21:23:51 -04:00] agent_3 - phase4 start

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: Phase 3 is accepted; Phase 4 should freeze architecture and harden the machine-native dataset path over wider synchronized ranges. Trust/reporting needs to become stricter and more useful without weakening publication gates.
phase: Phase 4
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli
summary: Starting Phase 4 hardening on the nonhuman dataset path with focus on wider-range compile reliability, stricter and clearer trust gating, reproducible artifact lifecycle behavior, and more useful inspect/diff research ergonomics.
needs: Will stay on public boundaries only and log any public-surface drift in contracts/docs/spec examples immediately.
files: feedbacks/latest.md, chat/contracts.md, chat/coordination.md, chat/agent_3.md, mt5pipe/state/public.py, mt5pipe/features/public.py, mt5pipe/labels/public.py, mt5pipe/compiler/public.py
```

### [2026-04-04 22:28:11 -04:00] agent_3 - phase4 continuation start

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: Phase 4 should stay disciplined: freeze architecture, harden the current nonhuman dataset path, and make trust/reporting more informative without weakening gates. Wider synchronized-range reliability is the checkpoint standard.
phase: Phase 4 continuation
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli
summary: Starting the Phase 4 checkpoint audit/finalization pass. I am re-validating xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 against only stable public selectors, then tightening compiler/truth/catalog/CLI behavior wherever the live artifact path still produces ambiguous failures or weak diagnostics.
needs: Will keep the spec disciplined to currently stable selectors only and will record any checkpoint blockers precisely if the path is not truly green.

```

### [2026-04-04 22:44:59 -04:00] agent_3 - phase4 checkpoint pass

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: Phase 4 should close only if the nonhuman dataset path is boringly reliable over a wider synchronized range and trust/reporting is stricter and more useful without architecture churn.
phase: Phase 4 continuation
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli
summary: Finalized the stable-selector Phase 4 checkpoint path. xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 now compiles from public selectors only over 2024-02-26..2024-03-01, includes multiscale/*, publishes correctly, inspects/diffs with deterministic trust summaries, and focused compiler/truth/catalog/CLI tests are green.
needs: Checkpoint status is yellow rather than fully green because the live accepted artifact still carries research warnings: source_quality=62.87 (< preferred 75), HTF/event nulls are still present in the artifact, and some slice-specific columns are constant. Compiler/truth/catalog behavior itself is stable.

verification: pytest tests/test_compiler.py tests/test_truth_core.py tests/test_catalog.py tests/test_dataset_cli_compat.py -q -> 16 passed; python -m mt5pipe.cli.app dataset compile-dataset --spec config/datasets/xau_m1_core_v1.yaml --publish -> published/accepted 96.28; python -m mt5pipe.cli.app dataset compile-dataset --spec config/datasets/xau_m1_nonhuman_v1.yaml --publish -> published/accepted 96.28; inspect/diff by dataset:// refs returned deterministic trust decision/check-count/reason summaries
```

### [2026-04-04 23:15:37 -04:00] agent_3 - phase4 cleanup start

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: The cleanup pass should keep the current stable selector path and make the yellow issues more truthful, not quieter. The goal is a cleaner checkpoint answer around source quality, expected sparsity, and constant-column usefulness.
phase: Phase 4 cleanup
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli
summary: Starting the Phase 4 cleanup pass as checkpoint owner. I am re-evaluating xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 on the current stable selector set and tightening truth/inspect/diff classification around weak source quality, expected sparse columns, and slice-trivial constants.
needs: Will keep the spec on the stable registry-materialized selector path confirmed by Agent 2 and will not weaken publication gates to chase a greener badge.
files: feedbacks/latest.md, chat/contracts.md, chat/coordination.md, chat/agent_3.md, mt5pipe/state/public.py, mt5pipe/features/public.py, mt5pipe/labels/public.py, mt5pipe/compiler/public.py
```

### [2026-04-04 23:34:05 -04:00] agent_3 - phase4 cleanup complete

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: The cleanup pass should keep the stable selector path and make yellow issues more truthful instead of quieter. The goal is a stronger checkpoint answer around source quality, expected sparsity, and constant-column usefulness.
phase: Phase 4 cleanup
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli

```
agent: agent_3
type: completion
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli
summary: Reclassified expected sparse nulls and slice-trivial constants as accepted caveats, preserved unexpected nulls/blocking constants/source-quality shortfalls as explicit blockers, and surfaced the new truth summaries through compile-dataset, inspect-dataset, and diff-dataset. Fresh live workspace runs now show xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 as a green checkpoint rather than yellow.
needs: None for this checkpoint. Remaining caveats are accepted slice-trivial constants only, and current source_quality is 77.2389 so it is no longer below the preferred threshold.

### [2026-04-04 23:53:37 -04:00] agent_3 - phase5 start

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: Freeze the architecture that worked, keep the compiler/trust path as the center of gravity, and expand only where it improves research-grade artifact quality. Phase 5 training readiness needs disciplined lineage, reproducibility, and trust-gated usage rather than a kitchen-sink research layer.
phase: Phase 5
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli|training

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli/training
summary: Starting Phase 5 by designing a minimal but real training/evaluation path on top of accepted dataset artifacts. I am auditing the existing catalog/compiler surface first so the experiment registry, model registry, and CLI training workflow reuse the green Dataset OS rather than bypassing it.
needs: Will keep training strictly trust-gated, lineage-linked, and inspectable; any public compiler, registry, manifest, trust, or CLI behavior changes will be logged in contracts/docs immediately.

```

### [2026-04-05 00:35:38 -04:00] agent_3 - phase5 complete

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: Freeze the architecture that worked, keep compiler/trust as the center of gravity, and add only disciplined training-readiness layers with full lineage and hard trust gates. Phase 5 should end with one real institutional training path, not placeholders.
phase: Phase 5
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli|training

```
agent: agent_3
type: completion
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli/training
summary: Implemented the first trust-gated institutional training path on top of accepted dataset artifacts. The compiler boundary now includes ExperimentSpec plus experiment/model inspection helpers, the catalog tracks experiment specs and training runs, experiment/model artifacts are registered through the shared manifest system, and the CLI exposes run-experiment / inspect-experiment / inspect-model with deterministic summaries.
needs: Phase 5 is stable for one baseline model path only. Future phases should add richer model families, comparison tooling, and deeper evaluation diagnostics without weakening the trusted-dataset gate or splitting artifact lineage across parallel registries.

### [2026-04-05 14:45:50 -04:00] agent_3 - final hardening start

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: Phase 3/4/5 feedback still points to the same discipline: no architecture churn, stricter trust, wider synchronized coverage, and artifact lineage you can actually audit. This pass is focused on closing the remaining proof gaps rather than expanding capability.
phase: Phase 5 hardening
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli|training

```
agent: agent_3
type: update
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli/training
summary: Starting the final end-to-end hardening pass to turn the pipeline claim from yellow to green. I am fixing synchronized dual-broker production coverage, making truth enforce multi-broker requirements, tightening raw ingest accounting, hardening upstream artifact identity, and deduplicating merge diagnostics before re-running the live dataset and training path.
needs: Will preserve the current research/training workflow and stay on public boundaries only; any public compiler/truth/catalog/CLI behavior changes will be logged in contracts/docs immediately.

```

### [2026-04-05 15:31:12 -04:00] agent_3 - final hardening complete

feedback_read: yes
feedback_source: feedbacks/latest.md
feedback_summary: The last pass should close proof gaps, not add scope: enforce synchronized dual-broker requirements, make raw accounting auditable, make upstream artifact lineage reproducible, and prove the current production path live.
phase: Phase 5 hardening
area: compiler|truth|catalog|cli|training

```
agent: agent_3
type: completion
area: compiler/truth/catalog/cli/training
summary: Fixed the remaining end-to-end proof gaps and re-ran the live production path on a synchronized dual-broker slice. Production DatasetSpecs now declare required brokers + synchronized overlap requirements, truth rejects/publishes accordingly, raw tick reruns report net-new rows_added=0, state/feature/label manifests resolve immutable artifact-scoped parquet roots, merge diagnostics/QA stay one-file-per-day on rerun, and the rebuilt xau_m1_nonhuman_v1 artifact compiles, inspects, diffs, and feeds the training path successfully.
needs: The strong claim is now green for the defined production slice 2026-03-30..2026-04-02. The main operational caveat is scope, not correctness: future production ranges must still be synchronized/backfilled on both brokers before these source requirements will pass.
